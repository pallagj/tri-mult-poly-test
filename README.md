# tri-mult-poly-test

Given the following program:
"An Algorithm for Triangulating Multiple 3D Polygons"
[https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~taoju/zoum/projects/TriMultPoly/index.html](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~taoju/zoum/projects/TriMultPoly/index.html)

This program has a command line interface, but no visualisation, so I created this repository for a graphical interface for this project.
